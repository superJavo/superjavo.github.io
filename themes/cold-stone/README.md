# Cold Stone :tada:

A simple, clean, text-based [Hexo](https://hexo.io) blog theme.

[‰∏≠ÊñáÊñáÊ°£](README-zh.md)

## Foreword

In my opinion the main content of the blog should be text, but many Hexo themes with a lot of pictures, easy to distract the reader's attention, and some of the text-based theme features are somewhat simple, so the Cold Stone theme was born!
